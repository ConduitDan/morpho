\#\+File \mbox{[}tag\mbox{]}\+: \# File

The File class provides the capability to read from and write to files, or to obtain the contents of a file in convenient formats.

To open a file, create a File object with the filename as the argument \begin{DoxyVerb}var f = File("myfile.txt")
\end{DoxyVerb}


which opens {\ttfamily \char`\"{}myfile.\+txt\char`\"{}} for {\itshape reading}. To open a file for writing or appending, you need to provide a mode selector \begin{DoxyVerb}var g = File("myfile.txt", "write")
\end{DoxyVerb}


or \begin{DoxyVerb}var g = File("myfile.txt", "append")
\end{DoxyVerb}


Once the file is open, you can then read or write by calling appropriate methods\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}f.lines()            // reads the contents of the file into an array of lines.
f.readline()         // reads a single line
f.readchar()         // reads a single character.
f.write(string)      // writes the arguments to the file.
\end{DoxyVerb}


After you\textquotesingle{}re done with the file, close it with \begin{DoxyVerb}f.close()
\end{DoxyVerb}
